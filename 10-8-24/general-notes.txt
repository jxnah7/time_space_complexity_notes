The following topics describe how
    the time it takes to run your function
    grows
    as the size of your input (to your function)grows


when asked, "how long does it take to run this function?"
    consider
        how fast is your computer?
        are you running other programs at the same time?
        which language are you using?

so instead you should ask, 
    how does the runtime of this function grow as the size of the input grows

to answer this question we use a pair of tools called
    big O notation and Time complexity


time complexity = a way of showing how the runtime 
                  of a function increases as the size
                  of the input increases

linear time = straight line diagonal,  as input grows, time grows
constant time = straight horizontal line, as input grows, time does not
quadratic time = curving up, as input grows, time grows exponentially

people dont like expressing time complexity this way for some reason 
so thats why we have big O notation

n is usually the size of the input

linear time = O(n)
constant time = O(1)
quadratic time = O(n^2)
